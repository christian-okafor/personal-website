        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p className="reg">Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Christian Okafor and I'm an alumnus of the <i><b> University of California Berkeley</b></i>, where I 
        earned my <i><b> Bachelor of Arts in Applied Mathematics</b></i> in August of 2016. If you're a fellow Golden Bear, I'm sure the color scheme of this site may have already given this away, 
        <b> Go Bears!</b> </p>
        <p className='reg'>I engaged in this website, as a personal project, to satisfy multiple goals. I wanted this to be a project where I would be applying much of the new skills that I'm learning
        such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and React.js. I also wanted this site to showcase those aforementioned skills and to convince employers why I'm the right candidate for the job.
        </p>
        <p className='reg'> At the beginning of this project, I thought that I would be using a simple Flask app on the backend to serve up a few static HTML files, but I opted for a more dynamic web page design.
        Instead, I'm running a React.js built <abbr title='Single Page Application'>SPA</abbr> which renders specific information into the main content area. This was supposed to save time, but it ended up taking me down a rabbit hole
        of new skills needed to get this page up and running. I'm very proud of the progress that I've made so far, and I really look forward to being a lifelong learner of these technologies, as I do quite enjoy doing this.
        </p>
        <p className='reg'>
          Make sure to come back occasionally as I push new features/design changes to my website!
